  <string name="am_info_demo_header_2">How does it work?</string>
  <string name="am_info_demo_1">AlertMeter is a suite of digital tools for a safer and more efficient workplace. Our simple, non-invasive app measures employee alertness in ninety seconds. Our desktop software displays those results for managers, and our fatigue management specialists help unite employees and managers behind this revolutionary safety measure.</string>
  <string name="am_info_demo_2">Based on rigorous alertness and impairment research, AlertMeter empowers employees to empirically demonstrate their readiness, and gives managers new confidence in the teams they deploy.</string>
  <string name="am_info_demo_3">AlertMeter establishes an alertness baseline for each employee. That employee then regularly uses the AlertMeter app for real-time alertness measurements. If their result meets or exceeds their unique baseline, they’re ready to work. If they fall below that baseline, their manager is notified and equipped to protect that employee from taking on high-risk tasks until their alertness improves.</string>
  <string name="am_info_demo_4">Applied in any high-risk industry, AlertMeter saves lives, reduces costs, and promotes trust between managers and their employees.</string>
